# Description:
 <p> You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.</p> 

**example 1:**
```
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
```

**example 2:**
```
Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

**Constraints:**
```
The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
```


 ### Solution 1

```Python 
from lintcode import (
    ListNode,
)

"""
Definition of ListNode:
class ListNode(object):
    def __init__(self, val, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
"""

class Solution:
    """
    @param l1: ListNode l1 is the head of the linked list
    @param l2: ListNode l2 is the head of the linked list
    @return: ListNode head of linked list
    """
    def merge_two_lists(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        head = dummy

        while l1 and l2:
            if l1.val < l2.val:
                head.next = l1
                l1 = l1.next
            else:
                head.next = l2
                l2 = l2.next
            head = head.next
        
        if l1:
            head.next = l1
        if l2:
            head.next = l2
        
        return dummy.next
                    
Time complexity: O(N) Space complexity: O(1)
